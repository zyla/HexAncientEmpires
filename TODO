- network: handle disconnections
- Fix concurrency bugs in ConnectionService
- BUG: duplicate BT devices
- make it looks good on higher resolutions

HAVE TO_DO:
- Rework how we menage units to make them differ more ( inherits from unit class )
    units should return their attack in their own int getAttack(tile.type type); method
    units should have their special properties (more on that later)
- Try to make 3 or 4 or more user multi_player
    rework of the data sending protocol
    rework of taking input from other devices
    make possible to send map info thorough bluetooth for map editor and compatible issues
    basically if host decides on everything it is possible to make it backward compatible
    clients should calculate if initial unit placement is even and show message about it
- Make gold distribution and gathering
- Recruiting units in Castles
    decide on what condition it is possible to recruit an unit
    decide how gold is distributed
    make possible to place unit after purchasing it
- Health value displayed on unit ( bars are not suitable for our needs )
- YouTube video with Tutorial ( or interactive tutorial mission )
- End Game button that don't crush the game
- Make our own units textures

SHOULD TO_DO:
- Before game menu to chose map and other game settings
    map
    gold on start
    max unit count
    units on start
- Attack animations ( smoke / vibration / red splashed number )
- Message about ripostes with attack values
- Host sends
- maps stored in files
- Check if player lost and finish the game if happens
- play_test game to figure out best attack damage constants
- 1balance units speed and terrain move cost
    wolf is too fast on ground
    catapult is too slow
    golem is too slow
    roads are too fast ore there are too much of them on current map

COULD TO_DO:
- Refactor whole game to make testing possible
- Make some tests
- It is possible to make this MVC, but not necessary. This is how I understand MVC:
    Controller  - takes input from user and stores it somewhere where model can take it
    View        - takes info from model and draws it on the screen
    Model       - stores all data about the game, it is basically everything else
- Attack value pop-out splash effect
- In game map editor
- Campaign Mission
